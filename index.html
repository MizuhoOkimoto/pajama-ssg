    <h1>Silver Blaze</h1>

    <p>
      I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we sat down
      together to our breakfast one morning.
    </p>
    <p>“Go! Where to?”</p>
    <p>“To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”</p>
    <p>
      I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already
      been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of
      conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my
      companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his
      brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black
      tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh
      editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be
      glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I knew
      perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. There was but one
      problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis,
      and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex
      Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly
      announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was
      only what I had both expected and hoped for.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in the
      way,” said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by coming. And I
      think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about the
      case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. We have, I think,
      just time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the
      matter upon our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your
      very excellent field-glass.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the corner
      of a first-class carriage flying along en route for Exeter, while Sherlock
      Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed in his ear-flapped
      travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle of fresh papers which he
      had procured at Paddington. We had left Reading far behind us before he
      thrust the last one of them under the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing at his
      watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half miles an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>“I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.</p>
    <p>
      “Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty yards apart,
      and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that you have looked into
      this matter of the murder of John Straker and the disappearance of Silver
      Blaze?”
    </p>
    <p>“I have seen what the _Telegraph_ and the _Chronicle_ have to say.”</p>
    <p>
      “It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be used
      rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of fresh
      evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and of such
      personal importance to so many people, that we are suffering from a
      plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. The difficulty is to
      detach the framework of fact—of absolute undeniable fact—from the
      embellishments of theorists and reporters. Then, having established
      ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may
      be drawn and what are the special points upon which the whole mystery
      turns. On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross, the
      owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the
      case, inviting my co-operation.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tuesday evening!” I exclaimed. “And this is Thursday morning. Why didn’t
      you go down yesterday?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson—which is, I am afraid, a more
      common occurrence than any one would think who only knew me through your
      memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it possible that the most
      remarkable horse in England could long remain concealed, especially in so
      sparsely inhabited a place as the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour
      yesterday I expected to hear that he had been found, and that his abductor
      was the murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had come,
      and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson nothing had
      been done, I felt that it was time for me to take action. Yet in some ways
      I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.”
    </p>
    <p>“You have formed a theory, then?”</p>
    <p>
      “At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I shall
      enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it
      to another person, and I can hardly expect your co-operation if I do not
      show you the position from which we start.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while Holmes,
      leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking off the points
      upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had
      led to our journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as
      brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth year,
      and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross,
      his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the catastrophe he was the first
      favourite for the Wessex Cup, the betting being three to one on him. He
      has always, however, been a prime favourite with the racing public, and
      has never yet disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums
      of money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that there
      were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze
      from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the
      Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken to guard
      the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired jockey who rode in
      Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too heavy for the weighing-chair.
      He has served the Colonel for five years as jockey and for seven as
      trainer, and has always shown himself to be a zealous and honest servant.
      Under him were three lads; for the establishment was a small one,
      containing only four horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in
      the stable, while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent
      characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small villa
      about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no children, keeps one
      maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The country round is very lonely,
      but about half a mile to the north there is a small cluster of villas
      which have been built by a Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids
      and others who may wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself
      lies two miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles
      distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which belongs
      to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other direction
      the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming
      gypsies. Such was the general situation last Monday night when the
      catastrophe occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      “On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual, and
      the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the lads walked up to
      the trainer’s house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the
      third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a few minutes after nine the
      maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which
      consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a
      water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should
      drink nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very
      dark and the path ran across the open moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man appeared
      out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into the
      circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person
      of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth
      cap. He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was
      most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the
      nervousness of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over
      thirty than under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my mind to
      sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’
    </p>
    <p>“‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.</p>
    <p>
      “‘Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘I understand that a
      stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is his supper
      which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would not be too
      proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?’ He took a piece of
      white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket. ‘See that the boy has
      this to-night, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past him to
      the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. It was
      already opened, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. She had
      begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted to have a
      word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner
      of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand.
    </p>
    <p>“‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.</p>
    <p>
      “‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said the other.
      ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let me
      have the straight tip and you won’t be a loser. Is it a fact that at the
      weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and
      that the stable have put their money on him?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll show you how
      we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and rushed across the stable
      to unloose the dog. The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she
      looked back and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. A
      minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone,
      and though he ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of
      him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with the dog,
      leave the door unlocked behind him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The importance of
      the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor
      yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy locked the door before he left
      it. The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to get through.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent a
      message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker was excited
      at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realized
      its true significance. It left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs.
      Straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. In
      reply to her inquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his
      anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables
      to see that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could
      hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her entreaties
      he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband had
      not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set
      off for the stables. The door was open; inside, huddled together upon a
      chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favourite’s
      stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room
      were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during the night, for they
      are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously under the influence of some
      powerful drug, and as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to
      sleep it off while the two lads and the two women ran out in search of the
      absentees. They still had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken
      out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the
      house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they not only
      could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they perceived something
      which warned them that they were in the presence of a tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s overcoat was
      flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped
      depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body
      of the unfortunate trainer. His head had been shattered by a savage blow
      from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a
      long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was
      clear, however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his
      assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted
      with blood up to the handle, while in his left he clasped a red and black
      silk cravat, which was recognised by the maid as having been worn on the
      preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the
      ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that the same stranger
      had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so
      deprived the stables of their watchman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay
      at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of
      the struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared, and although a
      large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the
      alert, no news has come of him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the
      remains of his supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable
      quantity of powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the
      same dish on the same night without any ill effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise, and stated
      as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what the police have done
      in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely
      competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to
      great heights in his profession. On his arrival he promptly found and
      arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. There was little
      difficulty in finding him, for he inhabited one of those villas which I
      have mentioned. His name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of
      excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf,
      and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making in the
      sporting clubs of London. An examination of his betting-book shows that
      bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him
      against the favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      “On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come down to
      Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the King’s Pyland
      horses, and also about Desborough, the second favourite, which was in
      charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton stables. He did not attempt to deny
      that he had acted as described upon the evening before, but declared that
      he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand
      information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very pale, and was
      utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered
      man. His wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the
      night before, and his stick, which was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead,
      was just such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the
      terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the state of
      Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his assailants must bear
      his mark upon him. There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you
      can give me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which Holmes,
      with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though most of the
      facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreciated their
      relative importance, nor their connection to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon Straker
      may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which
      follow any brain injury?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that case one
      of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory of the
      police can be.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to
      it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I take it, that this
      Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a
      duplicate key, opened the stable door and took out the horse, with the
      intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is
      missing, so that Simpson must have put this on. Then, having left the door
      open behind him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was
      either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued. Simpson
      beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick without receiving any
      injury from the small knife which Straker used in self-defence, and then
      the thief either led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it
      may have bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the
      moors. That is the case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it
      is, all other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall
      very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and until then
      I cannot really see how we can get much further than our present
      position.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock, which lies,
      like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor.
      Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the station—the one a tall, fair man
      with lion-like hair and beard and curiously penetrating light blue eyes;
      the other a small, alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and
      gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was
      Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector Gregory, a
      man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the Colonel.
      “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested, but I
      wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker and in
      recovering my horse.”
    </p>
    <p>“Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.</p>
    <p>
      “I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said the
      Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt
      like to see the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we
      drive.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and were
      rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector Gregory was
      full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw
      in an occasional question or interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with
      his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with
      interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. Gregory was formulating
      his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he remarked, “and I
      believe myself that he is our man. At the same time I recognise that the
      evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>“How about Straker’s knife?”</p>
    <p>
      “We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his
      fall.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If so,
      it would tell against this man Simpson.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The evidence
      against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the
      disappearance of the favourite. He lies under suspicion of having poisoned
      the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a
      heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man’s hand. I really
      think we have enough to go before a jury.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to rags,” said
      he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to
      injure it why could he not do it there? Has a duplicate key been found in
      his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where
      could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as
      this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid
      to give to the stable-boy?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse. But
      your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a
      stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer.
      The opium was probably brought from London. The key, having served its
      purpose, would be hurled away. The horse may be at the bottom of one of
      the pits or old mines upon the moor.”
    </p>
    <p>“What does he say about the cravat?”</p>
    <p>
      “He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it. But a
      new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his
      leading the horse from the stable.”
    </p>
    <p>Holmes pricked up his ears.</p>
    <p>
      “We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on
      Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On
      Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was some understanding
      between Simpson and these gypsies, might he not have been leading the
      horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?”
    </p>
    <p>“It is certainly possible.”</p>
    <p>
      “The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also examined every
      stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.”
    </p>
    <p>“There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. As
      Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest
      in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown, the trainer, is known
      to have had large bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor
      Straker. We have, however, examined the stables, and there is nothing to
      connect him with the affair.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of the
      Mapleton stables?”
    </p>
    <p>“Nothing at all.”</p>
    <p>
      Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased. A few
      minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with
      overhanging eaves which stood by the road. Some distance off, across a
      paddock, lay a long grey-tiled out-building. In every other direction the
      low curves of the moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched
      away to the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a
      cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton stables.
      We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back
      with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his
      own thoughts. It was only when I touched his arm that he roused himself
      with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at him in
      some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in his eyes and a
      suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to
      his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where
      he had found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr.
      Holmes?” said Gregory.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two
      questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”</p>
    <p>“He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”</p>
    <p>“I have always found him an excellent servant.”</p>
    <p>
      “I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the
      time of his death, Inspector?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would care to
      see them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat round
      the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a
      small heap of things before us. There was a box of vestas, two inches of
      tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a pouch of seal-skin with half
      an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five
      sovereigns in gold, an aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an
      ivory-handled knife with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss &
      Co., London.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and examining
      it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it, that it is the one
      which was found in the dead man’s grasp. Watson, this knife is surely in
      your line?”
    </p>
    <p>“It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.</p>
    <p>
      “I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. A
      strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition,
      especially as it would not shut in his pocket.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his body,”
      said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had lain upon the
      dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. It was a
      poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hands on at the
      moment.”
    </p>
    <p>“Very possible. How about these papers?”</p>
    <p>
      “Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them is a
      letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a milliner’s
      account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by Madame Lesurier, of
      Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs. Straker tells us that Derbyshire
      was a friend of her husband’s and that occasionally his letters were
      addressed here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked Holmes,
      glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a
      single costume. However there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we
      may now go down to the scene of the crime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting in the
      passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the Inspector’s
      sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager, stamped with the print of
      a recent horror.
    </p>
    <p>“Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.</p>
    <p>
      “No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to help us,
      and we shall do all that is possible.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time ago, Mrs.
      Straker?” said Holmes.
    </p>
    <p>“No, sir; you are mistaken.”</p>
    <p>
      “Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of
      dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”
    </p>
    <p>“I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.</p>
    <p>
      “Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he followed
      the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow
      in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the furze-bush
      upon which the coat had been hung.
    </p>
    <p>“There was no wind that night, I understand,” said Holmes.</p>
    <p>“None; but very heavy rain.”</p>
    <p>
      “In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush, but
      placed there.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, it was laid across the bush.”</p>
    <p>
      “You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been trampled
      up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since Monday night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have all stood
      upon that.”
    </p>
    <p>“Excellent.”</p>
    <p>
      “In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of Fitzroy
      Simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!” Holmes took the bag, and,
      descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a more central
      position. Then stretching himself upon his face and leaning his chin upon
      his hands, he made a careful study of the trampled mud in front of him.
      “Hullo!” said he, suddenly. “What’s this?” It was a wax vesta half burned,
      which was so coated with mud that it looked at first like a little chip of
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector, with an
      expression of annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was looking
      for it.”
    </p>
    <p>“What! You expected to find it?”</p>
    <p>“I thought it not unlikely.”</p>
    <p>
      He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of each of
      them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to the rim of the
      hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector. “I have
      examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the impertinence to do
      it again after what you say. But I should like to take a little walk over
      the moor before it grows dark, that I may know my ground to-morrow, and I
      think that I shall put this horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion’s
      quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. “I wish you
      would come back with me, Inspector,” said he. “There are several points on
      which I should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not
      owe it to the public to remove our horse’s name from the entries for the
      Cup.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the name
      stand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,” said
      he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you have finished your
      walk, and we can drive together into Tavistock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked slowly across
      the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Mapleton,
      and the long, sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening
      into rich, ruddy browns where the faded ferns and brambles caught the
      evening light. But the glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my
      companion, who was sunk in the deepest thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the question of
      who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding
      out what has become of the horse. Now, supposing that he broke away during
      or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to? The horse is a very
      gregarious creature. If left to himself his instincts would have been
      either to return to King’s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he
      run wild upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why
      should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when they hear of
      trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. They could not
      hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by
      taking him. Surely that is clear.”
    </p>
    <p>“Where is he, then?”</p>
    <p>
      “I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or to
      Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at Mapleton. Let us
      take that as a working hypothesis and see what it leads us to. This part
      of the moor, as the Inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls
      away towards Mapleton, and you can see from here that there is a long
      hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday night. If our
      supposition is correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there
      is the point where we should look for his tracks.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more
      minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’ request I walked
      down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty
      paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me.
      The track of a horse was plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of
      him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one quality which
      Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have happened, acted upon the
      supposition, and find ourselves justified. Let us proceed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of dry,
      hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on the tracks. Then
      we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite
      close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing
      with a look of triumph upon his face. A man’s track was visible beside the
      horse’s.
    </p>
    <p>“The horse was alone before,” I cried.</p>
    <p>“Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”</p>
    <p>
      The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of King’s Pyland.
      Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it. His eyes were on the
      trail, but I happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise
      the same tracks coming back again in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      “One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You have saved
      us a long walk, which would have brought us back on our own traces. Let us
      follow the return track.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led up to
      the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a groom ran out from
      them.
    </p>
    <p>“We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.</p>
    <p>
      “I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger and thumb
      in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see your master, Mr.
      Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock to-morrow morning?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always the
      first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself.
      No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch
      your money. Afterwards, if you like.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from his
      pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a
      hunting-crop swinging in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your business!
      And you, what the devil do you want here?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the sweetest of
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers here. Be
      off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s ear. He
      started violently and flushed to the temples.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”</p>
    <p>
      “Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it over in your
      parlour?”
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, come in if you wish to.”</p>
    <p>
      Holmes smiled. “I shall not keep you more than a few minutes, Watson,”
      said he. “Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys before Holmes
      and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such a change as had been
      brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. His face was ashy pale,
      beads of perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until the
      hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing
      manner was all gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like
      a dog with its master.
    </p>
    <p>“Your instructions will be done. It shall all be done,” said he.</p>
    <p>
      “There must be no mistake,” said Holmes, looking round at him. The other
      winced as he read the menace in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I change it
      first or not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “No, don’t,” said he;
      “I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or—”
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!”</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” He turned
      upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the other held out to
      him, and we set off for King’s Pyland.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas
      Brown I have seldom met with,” remarked Holmes as we trudged along
      together.
    </p>
    <p>“He has the horse, then?”</p>
    <p>
      “He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly what his
      actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that I was
      watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly square toes in the
      impressions, and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them. Again,
      of course no subordinate would have dared to do such a thing. I described
      to him how, when according to his custom he was the first down, he
      perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor. How he went out to it,
      and his astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has
      given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power the only
      horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. Then I
      described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to King’s
      Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until
      the race was over, and how he had led it back and concealed it at
      Mapleton. When I told him every detail he gave it up and thought only of
      saving his own skin.”
    </p>
    <p>“But his stables had been searched?”</p>
    <p>“Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.”</p>
    <p>
      “But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now, since he has
      every interest in injuring it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He knows that
      his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to show much
      mercy in any case.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own methods, and
      tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the advantage of being
      unofficial. I don’t know whether you observed it, Watson, but the
      Colonel’s manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. I am inclined now
      to have a little amusement at his expense. Say nothing to him about the
      horse.”
    </p>
    <p>“Certainly not without your permission.”</p>
    <p>
      “And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the question of
      who killed John Straker.”
    </p>
    <p>“And you will devote yourself to that?”</p>
    <p>“On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”</p>
    <p>
      I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few hours in
      Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation which he had begun
      so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to me. Not a word more could I
      draw from him until we were back at the trainer’s house. The Colonel and
      the Inspector were awaiting us in the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said Holmes. “We
      have had a charming little breath of your beautiful Dartmoor air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>“So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said he.</p>
    <p>
      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave difficulties in
      the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however, that your horse will start
      upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will have your jockey in readiness. Might
      I ask for a photograph of Mr. John Straker?”
    </p>
    <p>The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.</p>
    <p>
      “My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you to wait
      here for an instant, I have a question which I should like to put to the
      maid.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London consultant,” said
      Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the room. “I do not see that we
      are any further than when he came.”
    </p>
    <p>“At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said I.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I have his assurance,” said the Colonel, with a shrug of his
      shoulders. “I should prefer to have the horse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he entered the
      room again.
    </p>
    <p>“Now, gentlemen,” said he, “I am quite ready for Tavistock.”</p>
    <p>
      As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the door open
      for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and
      touched the lad upon the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “Who attends to them?”
    </p>
    <p>“I do, sir.”</p>
    <p>“Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone lame, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled and rubbed
      his hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my arm.
      “Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular epidemic among
      the sheep. Drive on, coachman!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor opinion which
      he had formed of my companion’s ability, but I saw by the Inspector’s face
      that his attention had been keenly aroused.
    </p>
    <p>“You consider that to be important?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“Exceedingly so.”</p>
    <p>“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?”</p>
    <p>“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”</p>
    <p>“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”</p>
    <p>“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.</p>
    <p>
      Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for Winchester
      to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met us by appointment
      outside the station, and we drove in his drag to the course beyond the
      town. His face was grave, and his manner was cold in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>“I have seen nothing of my horse,” said he.</p>
    <p>“I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked Holmes.</p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was very angry. “I have been on the turf for twenty years, and
      never was asked such a question as that before,” said he. “A child would
      know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and his mottled off-foreleg.”
    </p>
    <p>“How is the betting?”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen to one
      yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter, until you can
      hardly get three to one now.”
    </p>
    <p>“Hum!” said Holmes. “Somebody knows something, that is clear.”</p>
    <p>
      As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I glanced at the
      card to see the entries. It ran:—
    </p>
    <p>
      Wessex Plate. 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and five
      year olds. Second, £300. Third, £200. New course (one mile and five
      furlongs). 1. Mr. Heath Newton’s The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket). 2.
      Colonel Wardlaw’s Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket). 3. Lord
      Backwater’s Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves). 4. Colonel Ross’s Silver
      Blaze (black cap, red jacket). 5. Duke of Balmoral’s Iris (yellow and
      black stripes). 6. Lord Singleford’s Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).
    </p>
    <p>
      “We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,” said the
      Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favourite?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Five to four against Silver Blaze!” roared the ring. “Five to four
      against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough! Five to four on
      the field!”
    </p>
    <p>“There are the numbers up,” I cried. “They are all six there.”</p>
    <p>
      “All six there? Then my horse is running,” cried the Colonel in great
      agitation. “But I don’t see him. My colours have not passed.”
    </p>
    <p>“Only five have passed. This must be he.”</p>
    <p>
      As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing enclosure and
      cantered past us, bearing on its back the well-known black and red of the
      Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “That beast has not a white hair
      upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr. Holmes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend, imperturbably.
      For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass. “Capital! An excellent
      start!” he cried suddenly. “There they are, coming round the curve!”
    </p>
    <p>
      From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight. The six
      horses were so close together that a carpet could have covered them, but
      half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable showed to the front. Before
      they reached us, however, Desborough’s bolt was shot, and the Colonel’s
      horse, coming away with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before
      its rival, the Duke of Balmoral’s Iris making a bad third.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over his
      eyes. “I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it. Don’t you
      think that you have kept up your mystery long enough, Mr. Holmes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go round and
      have a look at the horse together. Here he is,” he continued, as we made
      our way into the weighing enclosure, where only owners and their friends
      find admittance. “You have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of
      wine, and you will find that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.”
    </p>
    <p>“You take my breath away!”</p>
    <p>
      “I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of running him
      just as he was sent over.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and well. It
      never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand apologies for having
      doubted your ability. You have done me a great service by recovering my
      horse. You would do me a greater still if you could lay your hands on the
      murderer of John Straker.”
    </p>
    <p>“I have done so,” said Holmes quietly.</p>
    <p>
      The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. “You have got him! Where is
      he, then?”
    </p>
    <p>“He is here.”</p>
    <p>“Here! Where?”</p>
    <p>“In my company at the present moment.”</p>
    <p>
      The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under
      obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what you have
      just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sherlock Holmes laughed. “I assure you that I have not associated you with
      the crime, Colonel,” said he. “The real murderer is standing immediately
      behind you.” He stepped past and laid his hand upon the glossy neck of the
      thoroughbred.
    </p>
    <p>“The horse!” cried both the Colonel and myself.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was done in
      self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of
      your confidence. But there goes the bell, and as I stand to win a little
      on this next race, I shall defer a lengthy explanation until a more
      fitting time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as we whirled
      back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a short one to Colonel
      Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to our companion’s narrative of
      the events which had occurred at the Dartmoor training-stables upon the
      Monday night, and the means by which he had unravelled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I confess,” said he, “that any theories which I had formed from the
      newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were indications
      there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their
      true import. I went to Devonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson
      was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that the evidence against
      him was by no means complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as
      we reached the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the
      curried mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and
      remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in my own
      mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I confess,” said the Colonel, “that even now I cannot see how it helps
      us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium is by no
      means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible.
      Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater would undoubtedly detect
      it, and would probably eat no more. A curry was exactly the medium which
      would disguise this taste. By no possible supposition could this stranger,
      Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family
      that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that
      he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a
      dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavour. That is
      unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our
      attention centres upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could
      have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. The opium was added
      after the dish was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the
      same for supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to
      that dish without the maid seeing them?
    </p>
    <p>
      “Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the
      silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. The
      Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet,
      though some one had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked
      enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor
      was some one whom the dog knew well.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker went down
      to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For
      what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his
      own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss to know why. There have been cases
      before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying
      against their own horses, through agents, and then preventing them from
      winning by fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some
      surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the contents of
      his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was
      found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would
      choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told us, a form of knife which
      is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery. And it was to
      be used for a delicate operation that night. You must know, with your wide
      experience of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a
      slight nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it
      subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so treated
      would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down to a strain in
      exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play.”
    </p>
    <p>“Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.</p>
    <p>
      “We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take the horse
      out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have certainly roused the
      soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick of the knife. It was
      absolutely necessary to do it in the open air.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why he needed
      the candle, and struck the match.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate enough to
      discover not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. As a man
      of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people’s bills
      about in their pockets. We have most of us quite enough to do to settle
      our own. I at once concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and
      keeping a second establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there
      was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as you
      are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can buy
      twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned Mrs. Straker
      as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that
      it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner’s address, and
      felt that by calling there with Straker’s photograph I could easily
      dispose of the mythical Derbyshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      “From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse to a
      hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his flight had
      dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with some idea, perhaps,
      that he might use it in securing the horse’s leg. Once in the hollow, he
      had got behind the horse and had struck a light; but the creature
      frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals
      feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel
      shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of
      the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so,
      as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make it clear?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been there!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that so astute
      a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without
      a little practice. What could he practice on? My eyes fell upon the sheep,
      and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my
      surmise was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had recognised
      Straker as an excellent customer of the name of Derbyshire, who had a very
      dashing wife, with a strong partiality for expensive dresses. I have no
      doubt that this woman had plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so
      led him into this miserable plot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where was the
      horse?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We must have
      an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham Junction, if I am
      not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in less than ten minutes. If you
      care to smoke a cigar in our rooms, Colonel, I shall be happy to give you
      any other details which might interest you.”
