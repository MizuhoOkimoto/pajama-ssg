- Convert the file name as the title in the head tag
- Convert the first line in the .txt file as an h1 tag
- Convert Markdown files into HTML(With italic, bold, and horizontal rule)

## Option Features

- type `-s` or `-stylesheet` on the command line, it will be converted to a style tag link
- [Update] type `-l` or `-lang` on the command line, it will generate the lang attribute on the root <html> element

 I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,‚Äù said Holmes, as we
 sat down together to our breakfast one morning.

 ‚ÄúGo! Where to?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúTo Dartmoor; to King‚Äôs Pyland.‚Äù

 I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England.

```
